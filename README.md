Programming Assignment 2 - Bon-ao, Angelo B. - ECE2112 - 2ECED

After the lecture on Numerical Python, solving the problems for programming assignment two was pretty straight on as the needed syntax and commands were already tackled during the previous lesson.

For the first problem, which is the normalization problem, I used the .random.random command for an array to create a 5x5 array with random variables in it. 
For the mean and standard deviation, I individually stored them in a variable as it made coding more readable than straight-up putting the command inside the full equation. 
I stored the mean in 'mean' and stored the standard deviation in 'std_dev'. 

Inputting all the data inside the equation given by the problem, I then stored the data from the normalization equation inside 'Z_X', for it to be denoted as the Z of X or the Normalized array of X. Lastly, I saved the data of 'Z_X' into 'X_normalized.npy'.
